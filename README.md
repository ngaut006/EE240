## Introduction

The BigGAN project is an implementation of the BigGAN (Big Generative Adversarial Network) model, which is a state-of-the-art generative model for generating high-resolution images. This project aims to provide an easy-to-understand and runnable implementation of BigGAN using PyTorch.

The "BigGan.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook file provides a step-by-step guide on how to train and generate images using the BigGAN model. It includes detailed explanations and code snippets to help you understand the model and its components.
